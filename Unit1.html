      <h3>History of WWW.</h3>
      <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN, a research organization in Switzerland. <br/>He developed it as a way for scientists to easily share information across different computers.<br/> The first website went live in 1991, providing basic information about the WWW. <br/>Since then, the WWW has grown into a vast network of interconnected webpages, serving as a hub for communication, research, entertainment, and much more.<br/> Its development has revolutionized how we access and share information globally.</p>
        <h3>Evolution of HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 1990s. Here's a brief overview of its evolution:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>HTML 1.0 (1991):</b> This was the first version of HTML, primarily focused on structuring text documents with basic elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists. It introduced the concept of hyperlinks.</li>
    <li> <b>HTML 2.0 (1995):</b> This version added features like tables, forms, and image support. It also introduced the &lt;meta&gt; tag for specifying metadata about the document.</li>
    <li><b>HTML 3.2 (1997):</b> This version standardized many features that were previously only supported by certain browsers. It introduced support for frames, scripting, and improved table capabilities.</li>
    <li><b>HTML 4.01 (1999):</b> HTML 4.01 refined and extended the features introduced in previous versions. It added support for style sheets (CSS), scripting with JavaScript, and introduced more semantic elements.</li>
    <li> <b>XHTML (2000):</b> XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) was introduced as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML syntax. It aimed to make HTML more compatible with XML and to enforce stricter syntax rules.</li>
    <li><b>HTML5 (2014):</b> HTML5 brought significant changes and improvements to HTML. It introduced new semantic elements (e.g., &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;), native support for multimedia elements (audio, video), canvas for graphics, and support for offline web applications. It also included APIs for geolocation, drag and drop, and web storage.</li>
    <li> <b>HTML Living Standard (Ongoing):</b> Instead of releasing new versions, HTML is now maintained as a "living standard," continuously evolving with new features and improvements. Browser vendors implement features as they become standardized, leading to a more dynamic development process.</li>
</ol>
    <p> HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands of modern web development, with ongoing efforts to improve accessibility, performance, and flexibility.</p>      
    <h3>Different HTML Version</h3>
 <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. Over the years, HTML has evolved through various versions, each introducing new features and improvements. Here are some of the major versions of HTML:</p>
<ol>
 <li><b>HTML 1.0:</b> This was the first version of HTML, introduced in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. It provided basic markup for structuring documents with elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.</li>
<li><b>HTML 2.0:</b> Published in 1995, HTML 2.0 added support for features like forms and tables, as well as inline images.</li>
<li><b>HTML 3.2:</b> Released in 1997, HTML 3.2 included additional features such as support for applets, text flow around images, and text alignment options.</li>
<li><b>HTML 4.01:</b>This version, released in 1999, introduced more sophisticated features like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling, scripting capabilities with JavaScript, and support for multimedia elements like audio and video.</li>
<li><b>XHTML (Extensible HTML):</b> XHTML 1.0 was published as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using XML syntax, making it more compatible with other XML-based technologies. XHTML 1.1 was released later with stricter rules for syntax.</li>
<li><b>HTML5:</b> HTML5 is the latest major version of HTML and was finalized in 2014. It introduced numerous new features and APIs to enhance web development, including support for multimedia elements without the need for plugins, new semantic elements like `&lt;header&gt;`, `&lt;footer&gt;`, and `&lt;article&gt;`, as well as the `&lt;canvas&gt;` and `&lt;svg&gt;` elements for drawing graphics. HTML5 also provides better support for mobile devices and offline web applications </li> 
</ol>
<h3>Why HTML 5?</h3>
<p>HTML5 was developed to address the shortcomings of previous versions of HTML and to meet the demands of modern web development. There are several reasons why HTML5 was necessary and why it has become widely adopted:</p>

<li><b>Improved Semantics:</b> HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as `&lt;header&gt;`, `&lt;footer&gt;`, `&lt;nav&gt;`, `&lt;article&gt;`, `&lt;section&gt;`, and `&lt;aside&gt;`. These elements provide clearer and more meaningful markup, making it easier for search engines to index and understand the structure of web pages, as well as improving accessibility for users of assistive technologies.</li>
    <li><b>Better Forms:</b> HTML5 introduced several new form input types and attributes, such as `&lt;input type="email"&gt;`, `&lt;input type="url"&gt;`, `&lt;input type="date"&gt;`, `&lt;input type="range"&gt;`, and `&lt;input type="color"&gt;`, among others. These features make it easier to create forms with enhanced user experiences, including built-in validation and input controls.</li>
    <li><b>Offline Web Applications:</b> HTML5 introduced features like the Application Cache (AppCache) and Web Storage (localStorage and sessionStorage), which enable web applications to work offline and store data locally on the user's device. This allows for more robust and responsive web applications, even when there is no internet connection available.</li>
    <li><b>Mobile Support:</b> HTML5 was designed with mobile devices in mind, providing better support for touch input, geolocation, and device orientation APIs. This has facilitated the development of mobile-friendly and responsive web designs that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations.</li>
    <li><b>Cross-platform Compatibility:</b> HTML5 is supported by all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. This ensures consistent rendering and behavior across different platforms and devices, reducing the need for browser-specific workarounds and optimizations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, HTML5 has become the standard markup language for web development due to its rich feature set, improved semantics, better multimedia support, and cross-platform compatibility, enabling developers to create more powerful, engaging, and accessible web experiences.</p>
